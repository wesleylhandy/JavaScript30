    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    const person = {
        name: 'Wes Handy',
        age: 39
    }

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(cap);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 39,
        social: {
            twitter: '@wesleylhandy'
            facebook: 'handywl'
        }
    }
   
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);  //need clone deep function to copy on object

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //is there a performance issue here?
